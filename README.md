  ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or Download the Project**
   ```bash
    
   cd railway-management-system
   ```
2. **Create the MySQL Database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE railways;
   USE railways;
   ```
3. **Create Tables**
   Example table structures (modify as per your needs):
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE RAILWAY_EMPLOYEES_A (
       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       FirstName VARCHAR(50),
       LastName VARCHAR(50),
       Designation VARCHAR(50)
   );

   CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES_CONTACT_NUMBERS (
       EmployeeID INT,
       ContactNumber VARCHAR(15),
       FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES RAILWAY_EMPLOYEES_A(EmployeeID)
   );

   CREATE TABLE TRAINS (
       TrainID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       TrainName VARCHAR(50),
       DepartureTime TIME
   );

   CREATE TABLE STATIONS (
       StationID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       StationName VARCHAR(50),
       Location VARCHAR(100)
   );
   ```
4. **Insert Sample Data**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO RAILWAY_EMPLOYEES_A (FirstName, LastName, Designation)
   VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Clerk');

   INSERT INTO TRAINS (TrainName, DepartureTime)
   VALUES ('Express', '09:00:00');

   INSERT INTO STATIONS (StationName, Location)
   VALUES ('Central Station', 'City Center');
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project
Update the database connection details in `railway.py`:
```python
con = pymysql.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="your_password",
    db="railways"
)
```
Run the script:
```bash
python railway.py
```
Use the menu to perform operations:
```
1. Promote Employee
2. Pre/Postpone Train
3. Renovate Station
4. Queries
```

## üß™ Testing
- **Promote Employee:** Choose option 1 and update a sample employee.
- **Pre/Postpone Train:** Choose option 2 to modify departure time.
- **Renovate Station:** Choose option 3 to update station details.
